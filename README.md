# About
Simple reservation website made in react using create-react-app.
Inspiration was my old job, where I used to work with hotel database.
This project is a practice in design,~~animations,~~ routing and working with mock data. 
Also used to learn basics of react.

Since this is a fictional business all the social links, addresses, and contact information are fake.
Backend is mocked using static data.
